By using Cobit Wallet, including downloading one of our mobile applications or visiting our website, you agree to the use, disclosure, and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.
<br/>
What personal information do we collect from our users
We do our best to minimize the amount of Personal Information that we collect from Trust Wallet users. Your contact information, such as your phone number,, or email address (depending on how you contact us), may be collected when you communicate with us for support, or if you report a bug or other error related to Trust Wallet or when you interact with us through social media. When you use our Services, we process PUBLIC wallet addresses that you generate through Trust Wallet.
<br/>
Will we share your personal date with third parties
Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users’ personal information to others. We may transfer personal data to our service providers or third parties in connection with Trust Wallet’s operation of its business, as certain features on Trust Wallet rely on various third-party products and services (collectively “Third Party Services”), . These third party services providers only have access to certain Personal Information, such as your public Wallet addresses, to perform their functions and may not use it for other purposes. Furthermore, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protections laws. Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that TrustWallet or substantially all of its assets are acquired, users’ information will be one of the transferred assets. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners- like publishers, advertisers, developers, or right holders.
<br/>
How we use the information we gather
We primarily use the limited information that we collect to enhance Trust Wallet. Except if we sell all or a portion of our business, or as otherwise described below, we do not rent, trade, or sell your Personal Information. Some ways we may use your Personal Information are to: Contact you when necessary; Respond to your comments, questions, or issues related to bugs or errors with Trust Wallet; Provide you with additional information; Send you information and marketing materials about services and products available through Trust Wallet, using push notifications or other means; Train our team members; Other internal business purposes. Aggregated Personal Data and Non-Personal Information We may share or disclose aggregated Personal Data or Non-Personal Information with service providers or with other persons we conduct business with, including but not limited potential third-parties for the purpose of showcasing the performance of the company. These service providers and other persons may also share with us aggregated Non-Personal Information that they have independently developed or acquired. Additionally, we may combine aggregate information from the pixel tags, and web beacons, with similar data we collect from other visitors to help us improve our Services. When doing so, we do our best to ensure that aggregated information cannot be linked back to you. Agents or Third Party Partners We may provide your Personal Information to our employees, contractors, agents, service providers, and designees (“Agents”) to enable them to perform certain services for us, including improvement of website-related services and features, and performance of maintenance services. Business Transfers We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, your Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. By accepting this Privacy Notice, as outlined above, you consent to any such transfer. Protection of Us and Others We will share personal information outside of Trust Wallet if we have a reasonable belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request; to cooperate with law enforcement; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Trust Wallet, our employees, our users, or others.

You can do this by contacting us at support@trustwallet.com. We will provide you with a copy of the data we process about you. To comply with your request, we may ask you to verify your identity.

Data retention
Please note that even If you delete your Wallet or addresses from the Cobit Wallet mobile application, uninstall Cobit Wallet mobile applications from your device, or request that your information be deleted, we still may retain some information that you have provided to us to maintain Cobit Wallet or to comply with the laws and regulations to which Cobit Wallet is subject. If you have any question or objection as to how we collect and process your personal information, please contact support@Cobitwallet.com.
<br/>
Data security
We are committed to making sure your information is protected in accordance with applicable laws and our data privacy policies. We have selected third-party vendors that use the Ethereum network, including Coinbase, Shapeshift, and Changelly, that help us keep your Personal Information safe. Unfortunately, we do not control these third parties and therefore cannot guarantee complete security. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information and secure all connections with industry standard transport layer security. Even with all these precautions, we cannot fully guarantee against the access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion of data through events, including but not limited to hardware or software failure or unauthorized use. Any information that you provide to us is done so entirely at your own risk.
<br/>
Children
We are especially sensitive about children’s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children, and our users must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use our services. We don’t knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using Cobit Wallet on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used Cobit Wallet, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at support@Cobitwallet.com
